Assignment #:  1

Program due date: Tuesday 9/25/2018  

Handed in date:  Tuesday 9/25/2018

Source code file name(s):

DLB.java
ac_test.java




Other file name(s) (if relevant):

dictionary.txt
user_history.txt (will be generated by program)



Does your program run without error?:

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

As far as I know, yes. It adds words to a user DLB and reads them from it to 
predict those words first (as in from most recent history). 




Additional comments to the grader:

I had trouble checking/adding words from the userFile to the userDLB but I got 
it to work. I had to get rid of spacing in front of added words because for somereason it kept adding space in the user_history file so that when I went to add words for the next run it would add a bunch of spaces. Since I got rid of that,
it seems to run fine and I have been getting correct output
