Approach to the User History File



	I implemented the userHistory file using another DLB from my DLB class.
	
	To access two different DLB's I created separate methods in finding 
	
	suggestions. In each, I would find the node with the current string the 
	user is searching for and start from that node to begin searching for 

	word suggestions. In this sense, it should be a linear or log runtime as 
	we are traversing the dlb to find certain characters. How I added the 
	
	"saved" words from the user, was by adding them to their own dlb, going
 	through said dlb and adding each word to an arraylist in which I would

	just add each word from the list to the users file.
