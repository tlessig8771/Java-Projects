Additional comments to the grader:

*Note that I skip the first line for reading in the apartments so that if
you use a test file that doesn't include what the first line of the current
apartments.txt file contains my program will skip the first entry*

I don't have all cases for handling incorrect input so please take that into 
account when grading. Dr. Farnan said not to worry about that. I tried to 
get a decent amount of them but I did not get all of them. I tested this
thoroughly so if anything bad happens please let me know as it was working 
for me. Thank you.
